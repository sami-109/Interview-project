Website to search for text and highlights the text searched for, while providing the total number of posts found.

Your task is to create a search box where users can type in keywords or phrases, and your application returns results with the text being searched for highlighted. You can use any front-end framework you want (e.g. React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.).

No need for a backend to be integrated. Store an array of articles in a constant and make use of it.
