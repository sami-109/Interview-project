Website to search for text and highlights the text searched for, while providing the total number of posts found.

Your task is to create a search box where users can type in keywords or phrases, and your application returns results with the text being searched for highlighted. You can use any front-end framework you want (e.g. React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.).

No need for a backend to be integrated. Store an array of articles in a constant and make use of it.



/*It wouldn't work, I tried multiple different ideas, but I just can't figure out the proper javascript syntax to actually be able to filter out the results and search for values.

My final plan was to bascially search using letters, which loops over the array displaying the results.(filtering)

If the condition appears to be true and the value is found in the array articles, display that value, and toggle the class mark to each result, which highlights them. And if false, do not display the post, (could also toggle hide class so posts won't appear), and whether or not the value is found, execute the function to display total amount of occurrences.*/
