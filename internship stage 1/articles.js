    date: "Oct 7, 2022",
    body: `Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, 
    only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily 
    packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. 
    Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents 
    that they couldn't leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared 
    these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. 
    He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.`

       That was until it wasn't and the hopes and dreams came crashing down.`

    body: `Dave wasn't exactly sure how he had ended up in this predicament. 
    He ran through all the events that had lead to this current situation and 
    it still didn't make sense. He wanted to spend some time to try and make 
    sense of it all, but he had higher priorities at the moment. The first was
     how to get out of his current situation of being naked in a tree with snow
      falling all around and no way for him to get down.`
